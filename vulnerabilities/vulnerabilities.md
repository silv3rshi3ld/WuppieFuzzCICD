# Unsafe Consumption of APIs

The API Does not properly validate and sanitize data gathered from other APIs. The API sends the following request to store email in a third-party API.

- POST https://my-json-server.typicode.com/bnematzadeh/third-party-api/users

- Navigate to /about. Add your XSS payload in email and subscribe. The subscribed email will be returned from the third-party API to the application.

- localhost:3000/about?email={payload}

# Broken Authentication

  GET /profile/{YourUsername}: Get ref link from your profile
  POST /api/users + ref link
